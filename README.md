# AirBnB_clone
This project is a collaborative project that tests our skills in developing an app from start to finish using best practices, working in a team, and learning new languages and frameworks. Over a 4 month period the authors will be making a simple clone of AirBnB from front-end to back-end using languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and MySQL and using frameworks such as Flask.

The first task of the project is create a basic command interpreter using Python.

# Command Interpreter
## How to start it
To start the command interpreter use the following command:
`./command.py`

## How to use it
The command interpreter is used to take in commands and allow changes to be made to certain parts of the project without having to change the entire code base.

## Examples
`Insert Examples here later`
